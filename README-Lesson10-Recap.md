# ðŸ“š Module 4 â€“ Lesson 10 Recap: Functions in JavaScript

This document summarizes all major function-related topics reviewed and practiced during Lesson 10. The lesson included concepts such as scope, function types, execution timing, and higher-order logic.

## âœ… Topics Covered

### 1. Nested Scope
- Inner functions have access to outer variables (lexical scope).
- Demonstrated how closures preserve access to outer variables even after the outer function finishes.

### 2. Function Declaration vs. Expression
- **Function Declaration**: Hoisted, can be called before being defined.
- **Function Expression**: Assigned to variables, not hoisted, defined at runtime.

### 3. Arrow Functions
- Compact syntax.
- Implicit return for single expressions.
- Lexically scoped `this` makes them useful in callbacks and class methods.

### 4. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
- Executes as soon as it is defined.
- Common for protecting variable scope and initializing modules.

### 5. Callbacks & Higher-Order Functions
- **Callback**: A function passed to another function to be called later.
- **Higher-Order Function**: A function that takes or returns another function.
- Used in array methods, event handling, and asynchronous logic.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Examples Discussed

- Using `forEach` and `setTimeout` with callbacks.
- Writing private logic in IIFEs for modular applications.
- Triggering behavior on button clicks with higher-order logic.

## ðŸ§ª Quiz Topics
Covered key conceptual checks for:
- Callback usage
- Arrow function syntax
- Differences between declarations and expressions
- Behavior of IIFEs
- Real use of nested functions
