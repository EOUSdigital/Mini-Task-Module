# ‚úÖ Task Manager Lite ‚Äì Mini Project Challenge

This mini-project wrapped up Module 4, Lesson 10 by combining multiple concepts into a functional, DOM-based task module.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Encapsulate logic using an IIFE to protect scope.
- Store private task data (`privateTasks`) that is not exposed globally.
- Use a higher-order function to handle multiple operations on task items.
- Pass in callbacks for different output behaviors:
  - Console logging
  - DOM rendering
- Use a button to trigger processing logic dynamically.

## üß† Concepts Demonstrated

- **IIFE** for private module structure
- **Nested scope** for internal task processing
- **Function expression** for reusable helpers
- **Arrow functions** in callbacks and DOM logic
- **Callback chaining** through multiple layers of control flow
- **DOM manipulation**: Dynamically adding content with `textContent` and `appendChild`
- **Event listeners** to trigger logic via button interaction

## üìÅ Files Used

- `index.html`: Page layout with button and output container
- `script.js`: Encapsulated IIFE with task logic and render methods
- `style.css`: Optional for custom styling (not required for logic)
